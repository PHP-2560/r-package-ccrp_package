We will expand on our webscraping project to create an R package.  In our webscraping project, we pulled data from the Billboard Hot 100 webpage, and created functions and visualizations to explore frequency of key words from titles, frequency of sentiments attached to songs (through sentiment analysis), and overall rankings for songs over the past 60 weeks.  To expand on this, we are specifically interested in exploring any temporal trends across rankings and sentiments.  We have discussed looking at associations between top-ranked songs' sentiments and world events (e.g., political elections, natural disasters) for potential temporal trends.  We have scheduled a meeting with Adam next week to discuss our package plan further.
